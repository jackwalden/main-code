I found this project to be quite difficult for me. I have never really considered myself a creative person, and never really know what to do on projects that are as open-ended as this one. I chose to do a Wordle spinoff because it is a game that I have played for years now, something I share with my friends and family. I enjoyed the process of coding, but was faced with hours on end of troubleshooting and debugging, which was not so fun. I would definintely say I learned a good amount from this project, as it was very hands on and on my own. I will admit that I was not able to make the game as good as I wouldv'e liked, however I think that my work paid off regardless. It was very much a good learning experience and I would say that I learned more than I expected to.
